## LCA -- DAG [In **DAG** branch]

- **DAG Solution and its test code are in the src folder**
- LCA_DAG.java is the source code for solving the LCA problem in a Directed Acyclic Graph.

- LCA_DAG_Test.java is the JUnit test code for the methods in LCA_DAG.java

### How to run the code:
- After download, it should can be directly opened and run in Eclipse.
- However if you cannot open it, Please follow these instructions:
  - Create a new Java Project.
  - Import the above LCA_DAG.java into the project.
  - Create a new jUnit test named LCA_DAG_Test.java.
  - Replace the contents of LCA_DAG_Test.java created in Eclipse with the contents of the LCA_DAG_Test.java in src folder.
- If still cannot run them, please email to me: zhouc@tcd.ie
  
### Visualization the test cases in LCA_DAG_Test.java
- This is to make the tests I did for DAG look clearer.
- LCA_DAG with a node that does not exist in the graph.
  - DAG-0: Empty DAG

- LCA_DAG with two node exist in the graph.
